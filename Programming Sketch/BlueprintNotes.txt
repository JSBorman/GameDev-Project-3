Level Blueprint (some things below may not belong here)
  - Player Controller
  		Flying by WASD
  		Always falling some?
  - Package Random Spawn & Receivers Random Spawn (Same Idea)
  		Given known list of valid spawn points
  		Randomly assign packages type
  		Note: May not have any package assigned
  - Spawn offices at N, S, E, W & assign end of day rewards
  - List of all possible packages

=============================

Package Class Blueprint
 Vars:	
  String type
  	Name of the package, corresponding to the model
  Model + Animations
  int Cost
  	Money earned by package

  int getCost(){return Cost}

==============================

Player Class Blueprint
  Vars:
  	inventory[] = new List(Package)
		List of packages the player currently holds
  	int profit = 0
  		Amount of money the player has earned this level
  	int altitude
  		Distance from ground at any given point

  // When player taps the number corresponding to a filled inventory slot, drop the corresponding package
  deliverPackage(){
  	Triggered by key press 'input'
  	- If Inventory[input] has an item
  		- Drop item
  }

  //When a player flys into a package, add the package to their inventory
  pickupPackage(){
  	Triggered by collision with package
  	
  	If space in inventory
		Add package to inventory
  }

  //Gain money for succesfully delivered packages
  gainPayment(int payment){
  	profit += payment
  }

  //Triggered by touching ground (altitude = 0)
  onGround(){
  	if at postOffice
  		gainPayment(office.getReward())
  }

================================

/*Objects that receive packages*/
Receivers Class Blueprint
	Vars:
	- packWanted: String
	  	Contains string containing Package.Type
	- Bullseye
		Stored as a map or list of pairs:	[(radius, bonus)]

		The circles of increasing diameter around the receiver
		Awards points based on smallest diameter landed in
		I.e:
			circle 1: r = 5		Cost * 20
			circle 2: r = 10	C0st * 5
			circle 3: r = 20	Cost * 1
			circle 4: r = 50	Late Fees: Cost * .5
	
	//Triggered by package landing nearby
	Receive Packages(){
		If Package.type == packWanted
		- calculateBonus()
		- Player.gainPayment(calculateBonus() * package.cost)
	}

	// Calculates what to multiply the package.cost by
	int calculateBonus(){
		- Figure out which circle the package landed in
		- Return the bonus corresponding to the circle
	}

	void drawBullseye(){
		- Place bullseye image(?) around spawn model
	}

====================================

/*End of Level Points*/

====================================
Unclear Aspects:
	- Calculating bullseyes (circles around receivers corresponding to bonuses earned)
	- Minimap with live world data
